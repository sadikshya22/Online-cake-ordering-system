    <p>
      <strong>Cancellation during Cake Preparation:</strong> Once an order for a cake is placed and it is in the

      transitioned from the "preparing" status, the cancellation process cannot be initiated, and Users will not be
      eligible for a refund.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Refunds during the Processing Period:</strong> In the event that a cancellation request is made during the

      payment transaction as proof of purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that refunds will only be processed if the cancellation request is made during the processing period.
      Once the cake has entered the production phase, no refunds will be issued.
